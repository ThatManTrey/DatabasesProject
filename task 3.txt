Store No. -> Name, Address, Phone
Dist. ID -> Name, Address, Phone
ID -> Name, pay
SKU -> Name, Type, Price, Size
Store No., SKU -> No. of Item
Order No. -> Store No., Dist. ID
Order No., SKU -> No. of Item
Store No., ID -> Role

BCNF:
Product
Distributor
Employee
Location
Inventory
Employees

3NF:
Product
Distributor
Employee
Location
Inventory
Employees

Not in BCNF:
Order
-OrderNo -> Store No, Dist ID violates BCNF as Order No is not superkey for table

Not in 3NF:
Order
-Order No -> Store No, Dist ID violates 3NF as Order No is not superkey for table and DistID, Store No is a set of non-key attributes
-Gives us tables Order(Order No., Dist. ID, Store No.) and Order_Amounts(Order No., SKU, No. of Item) instead of Order(Order No., SKU, Store No., Dist. ID, No. of Item)
